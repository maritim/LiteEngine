  Decryption code comes from crypt.c by Info-ZIP but has been greatly reduced in terms of
  compatibility with older software. The following is from the original crypt.c.
  Code woven in by Terry Thorsen 1/2003.

  The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
  non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
  whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
  (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
        This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
  Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
  file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
  version without encryption capabilities).
